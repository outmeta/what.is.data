Is data” is that data is different types of information usually formatted in a particular manner. All software is divided into two major categories: programs and data. We already know what data is now, and programs are collections of instructions used to manipulate data.

We use data science to make it easier to work with data. Data science is defined as a field that combines knowledge of mathematics, programming skills, domain expertise, scientific methods, algorithms, processes, and systems to extract actionable knowledge and insights from both structured and unstructured data, then apply the knowledge gleaned from that data to a wide range of uses and domains.

So, now that we have a little better understanding of what data and data science are, let’s check out some interesting facts.

But first, what do we mean by “information?” Let’s backtrack a little and look at the fundamentals.
